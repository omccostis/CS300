# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem I was solving in the projects for this course was to design and implement a course planner program for the advising department at ABCU, which can assist advisors in efficiently managing and retrieving information about courses. The solution had to handle data and input validation, and be designed according to industry best-practices and standards.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by analyzing the requirements of the program and comparing a variety of common data structures. Understanding data structures was crucial for this task becauce the choice has a real impact on the program's performance. Weighing the options and comparing the runtimes of operations across different data structures allowed me to make an informed decision suited to the needs and requirements of the client.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I had to overcome a few roadblocks during testing, such as: handling different data formats by validating and skipping empty tokens when reading CSV files, ensuring accurate course lookups by converting user input and searches to uppercase, and error handling (like operation failures, invalid inputs, or missing files), so the program is more user-friendly.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project has demonstrated the importance of proper planning before writing real code. Creating pseudocode is a great way to plan out the functionality of the program and work out any issues before actual programming and testing. Breaking the project into smaller components and incrementally testing is super important, so you can design programs that are efficient, well thought-out, and as bug-free as possible. Thorough testing and anticipating user errors improves the usability of the program.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Separating tasks into distinct functions makes the program more modular and maintainable, improving collaboration if the program will be implemented by multiple developers. Writing detailed in-line comments makes the code more readable, is helpful for me during the debugging phase, and is very helpful for other developers when updating or repurposing the code (or parts of it thanks to modular development).
